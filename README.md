	This program can be run on your Linux PC or server using Python 3.
	In its current configuration, it tries to connect to Google's servers once every second to test if the internet connection is working.
	I use it to monitor Linux server uptime (assuming Google's server is up too of course). For this purpose I just have it run in the background, and check in on it every once in a while.
	
	To quit, press return.
